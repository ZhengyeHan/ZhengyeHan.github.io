    <title>Development of Intelligent Recognition and Improvement Platform for Shield Machine Muck</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        This project integrates <strong>AI with civil engineering challenges</strong>, specifically focusing on the intelligent recognition and improvement of shield machine muck in Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) tunneling.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project consists of two phases:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Recognized as a Beijing city-level Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, 
            this stage was led under the guidance of faculty mentors and focused on muck recognition using computer vision algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Awarded as a national-level Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, this stage was independently 
            proposed by me, including its core research question and methodological framework. I led the team in advancing the project, 
            which focused on applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for muck improvement.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        By addressing practical problems at construction sites, this project bridges academic research with real-world applications, offering insights into enhancing efficiency and adaptability in muck-related processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The research methodology evolved across two distinct phases:</p>

            <img src="/images/computer_vision_phase1_1.png" alt="Phase 1 Image 1" style="max-width: 48%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
            <img src="/images/computer_vision_phase1_2.png" alt="Phase 1 Image 2" style="max-width: 48%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
        </div>
        <li>
            <strong>Computer Vision-Based Muck Recognition:</strong> 
            The first phase employed supervised learning techniques. Using a dataset of muck images and videos provided by civil engineering experts, the project explored various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet, VGG, and YOLOv7. These models were trained and evaluated for accuracy in identifying muck properties, achieving accuracy rates of 96â€“97%. For video-based muck detection, YOLOv7 was employed to ensure real-time identification of muck flow, enabling its deployment in construction environments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Muck Improvement:</strong> 
            Building upon Phase 1, the second phase introduced a novel approach to optimizing muck improvement using DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient). The methodology involved:
            <ul>
                <li>Modeling muck conditions as input states and utilizing DDPG to predict optimal improvement agent proportions.</li>
                <li>Iterative training of the model to refine outputs, guided by the feedback of collapsibility and unconfined shear strength metrics.</li>
                <li>Employing Gaussian process regression to generate additional synthetic training data, addressing challenges posed by limited real-world samples.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>City-Level and National Recognition:</strong> 
            The project received city-level and national-level awards for its contributions to intelligent muck management in EPB tunneling.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Algorithmic Advancements:</strong> 
            The DDPG-based methodology demonstrated superior efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional approaches, especially in varying muck conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Technology Transfer:</strong> 
            Deployment of the trained computer vision models at construction sites enabled real-time muck identification and contributed to operational decision-making processes.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Challenges and Reflections</h2>
    <p>
        The project encountered several challenges, including:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Limited Data Availability:</strong> 
            The scarcity of muck improvement data posed a significant obstacle. To overcome this, Gaussian process regression was employed to simulate the relationships between muck properties and improvement agents, generating synthetic datasets to augment training processes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Interdisciplinary Integration:</strong> 
            Bridging AI techniques with civil engineering required a comprehensive understanding of both fields. Designing robust algorithms and validating their effectiveness in real-world conditions underscored the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration.
        </li>
    </ol>
