Hello, I am Zhengye Han (韩政业), an undergraduate student in the School of Computer Science & Technology at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/), where I study under the supervision of Professor [Zhigang Cao](http://en.sem.bjtu.edu.cn/show-910-467.html). Under his guidance, I embarked on my academic journey through the study of game theory.

During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege to join the Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies ([CFCS](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/)) at Peking University, working in the [daGAME](https://dagame.pku.edu.cn/) lab, where I focused on machine learning and game theory. This was an incredibly formative period in my academic growth. I am deeply grateful to Professor [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) for providing me with invaluable research and internship opportunities during this time. I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to PhD candidate [Zhijian Duan](https://zjduan.github.io/) for his important guidance throughout my time in the lab, which played a crucial role in my development. During my internship at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/), I had the pleasure of working with [Yeshu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PYXmSwkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yusen Huo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088549571). I truly appreciate the insightful advice they provided, particularly regarding academic pursuits and graduate school applications. Their support was instrumental in helping me navigate both my professional and educational pathways during this time. 

### Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of game theory and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on the following topics:
* Reinforcement Learning. Including auto-bidding in online advertising, sequential decision-making, and safe reinforcement learning.
* Game theory. With a focus on multi-agent scenarios.
* Deep learning. Including computer vision and its applications combined with reinforcement learning.


Additionally, I believe that using the knowledge I've acquired to contribute to the development of underprivileged regions, especially in the field of education, is my lifelong purpose. I am willing to promoting equal opportunities and reducing the wealth gap through educational advancements.

My personal motto is a quote from Harvard President Lawrence Bacow:
*"Recognize the role that good fortune and circumstance have played in your life, and please work to extend opportunity to others just as it has been extended to you."*

# Publication
* During my internship at Alibaba, I conducted meaningful research. I am the first author of a paper that presents our findings, which has been submitted to the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025. Due to the double-blind review process of the conference, I am unable to disclose further details about the paper until it is officially published.

 <p>This competition was hosted by the PKU-Alimama Artificial Intelligence Innovation Joint Lab, a collaboration between Alibaba Group and Peking University. As a member of the lab, I was actively involved in organizing the competition. I worked closely with <a href="https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Shuai_Dou1">Shuai Dou</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PYXmSwkAAAAJ&hl=en">Yeshu Li</a> to develop the agents for the competition system, focusing on creating robust models for decision-making in large-scale, competitive auctions.</p>

  </div>
   <p>This project was a collaboration with the School of Civil Engineering, where we applied deep learning (DL) for image recognition and reinforcement learning (RL) for intelligent optimization. The platform addresses challenges in muck detection and improvement, leading to the creation of a fully functional machine prototype. Our work resulted in a national invention patent and three software copyrights.</p>
