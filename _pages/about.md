Hello, I am Zhengye Han (韩政业), an undergraduate student in the School of Computer Science & Technology at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/), where I study under the supervision of Professor [Zhigang Cao](http://en.sem.bjtu.edu.cn/show-910-467.html) from the School of Economics and Management. Under his guidance, I embarked on my academic journey through the study of game theory.

During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege to join the Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies ([CFCS](cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/)) at Peking University, working in the [daGAME](https://dagame.pku.edu.cn/) lab, where I focused on machine learning and game theory. This was an incredibly formative period in my academic growth. I am deeply grateful to Professor [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) for providing me with invaluable research and internship opportunities during this time. I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to PhD candidate [Zhijian Duan](https://zjduan.github.io/) for his important guidance throughout my time in the lab, which played a crucial role in my development. I remain immensely appreciative of their support.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of game theory and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on the following topics:
* Reinforcement Learning. Including auto-bidding in online advertising, sequential decision-making, and safe reinforcement learning.
* Deep learning. Including computer vision and its applications combined with reinforcement learning.
* Game theory. With a focus on multi-agent scenarios.
